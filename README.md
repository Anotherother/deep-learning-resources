# deep-learning-resources
a Collection of resources I have found useful on my journey finding my way through the world of Deep Learning.

##Courses
[Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networkds for Visual
Recognition](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-likely-breakthrough-in-Deep-Learning-1)

[Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

Keras is my favorite framework for Deep Learning and is underneath compatible with both Theano and Tensorflow.

Learning](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-likely-breakthrough-in-Deep-Learning-1)


##Competitions
Kaggle is the place to be for Data Scientists and Deep Learning experts at the moment - but you don't have to be an
expert to feel the adrenalin of a $120000 competition

Kaggle competitions perfect for deep learning:

[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

[Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

[The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring)


##Tools of the Trade
###MatplotLib
Deep Learning is far from being an exact science and a lot of what you do is based on getting a feel for the underlying mechanics, visualising the moving parts makes it easier to understand and Matplotlib is the go-to library for visualisation

[Matplotlib official](matplotlib.org)

###NumPy
NumPy is a fast optimized package for scientific computing, and is also the underlying library a lot of Machine Learning frameworks are build on top of. Becoming a NumPy ninja is an important step to mastery.
