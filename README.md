# deep-learning-resources
A Collection of resources I have found useful on my journey finding my way through the world of Deep Learning.

##Courses
[Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)

[Coursera: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks)

Even though Deep Learning is a small but important subset of Machine Learning, it is still important to get a wider knowledge and understanding of Machine Learning and no course will give you a better understanding than the excellent course by Andrew Ng.

##Getting Philosophical
[What is the next likely breakthrough in Deep
Learning](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-likely-breakthrough-in-Deep-Learning-1)

Looking at [The major advancements in Deep Learning in
2016](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/major-advancements-deep-learning-2016/) gives us a peek into the future of
deep learing. A big portion of the effort went into Generative Models, let us see if that is the case in 2017.

##Competitions
Kaggle is the place to be for Data Scientists and Deep Learning experts at the moment - but you don't have to be an
expert to feel the adrenalin of a $150000 competition

Kaggle competitions perfect for deep learning:

* [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

* [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

* [The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring)

* [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection)

##Tools of the Trade
###Python
[Python Official](https://www.python.org/)

[Python Programming Tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

###MatplotLib
Deep Learning is far from being an exact science and a lot of what you do is based on getting a feel for the underlying mechanics, visualising the moving parts makes it easier to understand and Matplotlib is the go-to library for visualisation

[Matplotlib official](http://matplotlib.org)

[Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

[YouTube: Bare Minimum: Matplotlib for data visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZthnIfAbKAU)

###NumPy
NumPy is a fast optimized package for scientific computing, and is also the underlying library a lot of Machine Learning frameworks are build on top of. Becoming a NumPy ninja is an important step to mastery.

[NumPy official](http://www.numpy.org)

[100 NumPy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100%20Numpy%20exercises.md)

###keras-visuals
Visualise the training of your Keras model with an easy to use Matplotlib graph using one line of code.
